            Our Organisation is committed to protecting the privacy of the user

            POPIA, and (ii) such Personal Information is used for legitimate
            business purposes. The Organisation does not, except where otherwise
            permitted by law, collect, use or disclose your Personal Information
            without your consent. The Organisation operates its Website, and
            conducts its business in general, in accordance with South African
            legislation. The Organisation considers it imperative to protect the

            Organisation sends Personal Information outside of South Africa
            (including if such information is hosted offshore), the Organisation
            will ensure that it takes all reasonable steps to ensure that it
