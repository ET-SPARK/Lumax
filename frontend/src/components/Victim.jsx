            How exactly does the rental housing scam work?
          </div>
          <div className="section__paragraph">
            The criminals search websites and listings that list flats or homes
            to let. They take the information in those ads and post it, with
            their own e-mail address, in an ad on other websites or listings.
          </div>
          <div className="section__paragraph">
            An interested person will contact this person via e-mail or
            telephone. Victims are usually instructed to pay money over to them
            before taking occupation. This amount will usually be for the first
            month’s rental as well as a deposit.

          <div className="section__paragraph">
            The applicant might sometimes be asked to fill out an application
            with bank account details, ID document copy and other personal
            information. A Lease Agreement will also be signed but will be very
            short documents will few details and few clauses.

              <li>Intercepted Emails</li>
              <div className="section__paragraph">
                This involves scammers, hacking into the email of people
                involved in the transactions, such as agents or lawyers, by
                tricking home buyers into wiring funds to them instead of the
                appropriate parties. They often will use a generic email address
                indicating that the funds should be wired to a specific account
                which will then vanish without a paper trail. Changes made
                regarding payment details must always be done by the seller in
                person if possible, or telephonically verifying the email, and
                not via email alone.
              </div>
              <div className="section__paragraph">
                Protect yourself by double checking everything, verifying all
                emailed instructions that deal with the purchase even if they’re
                from trusted parties, any bank detail changes need to be
                accompanied by the required verification of the bank accounts in
                question.

              <li>Fraudsters posing as a Buyer</li>
              <div className="section__paragraph">
                They will approach a seller privately and show keen interest in
                the property and put in an offer. After a few days, the supposed
                buyer will contact the seller asking for a document to be signed
                to help them get their home loan approved, which the seller then
                signs without reading too much of the document only to discover
                later that a third party claims to have bought the home. It will
                be found that the scam artist (the first buyer) has been
                marketing the home online as an agent, by taking the photos off
                various websites, and has found a buyer who is also unaware that
                something is wrong – and who might have paid a large deposit
                over to the supposed agent. Make sure you check every detail
                when it comes to property sale transactions, documents can be
                falsified and email addresses cloned.
              </div>
              <li>Identity Theft</li>
              <div className="section__paragraph">
                Criminals have become much more experienced and are using stolen
                identity details not only to empty bank accounts but to obtain
                various credit accounts and even home loans. They are able to
                delay detection of the fraud for long periods while the unpaid
                bills and instalments mount up. The scammer will use false
                documents to pose as the property owner, register forged
                documents transferring a property to their name, and then get a
                new mortgage against the property. After securing a mortgage or
                line of credit, the criminal takes the cash and disappears.
              </div>
              <li>Bait and Switch Scheme</li>
              <div className="section__paragraph">
                This occurs when a prospective buyer offers an ‘above market
                value’ price to a seller. The seller, impressed by the high
                offer signs the contract, meanwhile the deceitful buyer has no
                intention to purchase the property. Once the seller signs the
                contract, the seller may only sell to that buyer for a specified
                time, when that time ends the fraudster asks to extend the
                contract a few weeks to work out closing details. Sounding
                reasonable, the seller agrees to the extension blinded by the
                high offer. In the meantime the seller keeps paying taxes,
                maintenance, utilities and insurance the buyer comes back to the
                seller with an excuse as to why this price no longer works, and
                requests a reduction to below market value and threatens to
                cancel if their demand is not met. Stressed by time and on-going
                costs, the seller agrees to the reduction.
              </div>
              <li>Duplicated Listings</li>
              <div className="section__paragraph">
                ‘Agents’ copy legitimate rental listings and advertise for a
                much cheaper price. Unfortunately, many people fall for these
                fake listings and wire money to the owners of these fake
                listings. When searching for a rental, do your research and make
                sure you are working with a reputable company or agent.
              </div>
              <li>Fake Rental Agents</li>
              <div className="section__paragraph">
                When you find a property you really like, you call the agent to
                arrange a viewing and they say they will meet you there. Later
                they call and say they won’t be able to make it anymore, but no
                need to worry the landlord will be there to show you around. The
                agent then promises to negotiate a lower price with the
                landlord. When you arrive at the house you find many other
                people interested in renting the same place. You call the agent
                back to negotiate a better price that you’re happy with; they
                will phone you back shortly to inform you of the new price, all
                you have to do is transfer the money for the first two months to
                secure the place. On moving day, you find someone else is moving
                in and the agent wasn’t an agent; they just found the property
                online and reposted it with their own contact information. They
                purposely send several people at a time to view the property to
                generate a sense of urgency for the potential renters.

            How to avoid being a victim of these scams:
            <div className="section__paragraph">
              <ul className="section__paragraph_li">
                <li>
                  Be wary when you are requested to make a payment for something
                  minor like a credit check or security deposit, in most cases,
                  there’s nothing you can do to get your money back because the
                  scammer can’t be tracked.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the price looks too good to be true, it probably is. Prices
                  are considerably higher than they were a few years ago.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The email sounds strange – some listings hide the email
                  address when you send a message, so you might not be able to
                  see the address if you respond to the listing. Scammers
                  usually use free email servers and they’ll often go by a
                  series of random letters to make them less easily traceable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Agent won’t show you the property – If you ask to see the
                  property and they claim it’s impossible, it’s probably a fake
                  listing. Agent will make time for people who are interested in
                  the property.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The seller pushes you – the faster a scammer gets you to agree
                  to a business deal, the faster they can steal your money and
                  avoid getting caught. The seller will often use high-pressure
                  tactics that attempt to push you into acting quickly in order
                  to purchase the home. Don’t be prodded by any seller to send
                  money.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The seller asks you to wire money – when you see the term
                  “wire money” or similar variation of that phrase come up in a
                  business conversation with someone you’ve never met, red flags
                  should go up. Many scams entail wiring of funds because it’s
                  more difficult to trace and enables the scammer to collect the
                  money sooner. Scammers will come up with a variety of
                  plausible reasons why the money should be wired rather than
                  sent through a bank or lawyer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The buyer or seller is foreign and wants to buy a home unseen
                  – most people want to at least see a property and become
                  familiar with the area before making a large investment. This
                  doesn’t mean you should be wary of all foreign inquiries, but
                  many scams often occur overseas because it’s harder to trace
                  the person behind the fraud. Foreign buyers who don’t ask
                  questions, act in haste, and don’t care to see the property
                  indicate a high likelihood of fraud.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Be well informed about market related prices within the area
                  you are looking to rent or buy. If a property is advertised
                  way below the market related price for that area it should
                  raise your concerns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you found a “bargain” online you should call the estate
                  agency to find out if the deal is for real. Don’t call the
                  number at the bottom of the ad because this number could lead
                  to a fake office. Rather find the actual office number, call
                  there and ask the receptionist to give you the number of the
                  specific agent or branch you are looking for.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Be wary of agents and landlord who seem too eager or pushy to
                  get you to live in their property or one they are marketing. A
                  legit agent or landlord will always conduct the necessary
                  checks and will not be too disappointed when you don’t show
                  much interest in the property.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the agent is constantly making up excuses as to why they
                  are not able to meet you or show you the property, you should
                  also be worried. The chances are good that they don’t have
                  access to the property and are stalling for time until they
                  can think of a clever way to get you to pay the deposit.
                </li>
                <li>Never pay a deposit before you have viewed a property.</li>
              </ul>

            <div className="section__paragraph">
